<b>What is Rock Buddy?</b>
Rock Buddy is a tool that provides leaderboards for Rocksmith, including for custom charts (currently only learn a song mode). Eventually it will be expanded to provide score attack leaderboards as well as displays with useful data to assist you on your Rocksmith journey!
<br /><br />
<b>Installation:</b>
The latest version can be found in the new-releases channel. Simply download the zip file and run the provided ".exe".
<br /><br />
<b>Prerequisites:</b>
Rock Buddy requires RockSniffer to be installed and running in order to operate properly. The latest release of RockSniffer can be found here: https://github.com/kokolihapihvi/RockSniffer/releases
<br /><br />
<b>Creating an Account:</b>
To create an account, click the "Sign Up" button on the login page and enter your account info. Once the account is created, log in and follow the steps on screen to verify your email address.
<br /><br />
<b>First Time Setup:</b>
The first time you run Rock Buddy, you will need to go to the "Config" section and tell it which Steam account you are using, as well as which Rocksmith profile it should import data from. Then you will need to provide the path to RockSniffer on your system to enable RockSniffer integration.
<br /><br />
Once the provided config has been entered, ensure RockSniffer is running on your PC and go to the "Sniffer" tab to begin sniffing! 
<br /><br />

The "Sniffer" page will follow Rocksniffer and display leaderboards for whatever song you are currently on in-game.
<br /><br />
<b><i>NOTE</i></b> that there is an intentional 10 second delay when switching songs to prevent the server from being overloaded with requests. If you want to load data for a song immediately without waiting 10 seconds you can click the "Snort" button to force the app to immediately load the new song.
