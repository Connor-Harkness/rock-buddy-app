# Getting Started

To start using addons, turn them on in the "config" window within Rock Buddy.

The default configuration settings should work for most users.

# Capture Addon

The capture addon provides a way to display Rock Buddy in OBS as a browser source for streamers. Simply add "capture/capture.html" into OBS as a browser source to use it!

# Configuration

If you plan on using addons with the default port on the same PC as you use Rock Buddy then there is no need to modify "config.js", however the hostname and port number are configurable to give flexibility to those with more complex setups. Just make sure the host name matches the name of the PC that is running Rock Buddy, and the port number matches what is in the Rock Buddy configuration page and you should be good to go!
